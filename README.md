**The theme is more focused on the Gnome Desktop, but supports Cinnamon, XFCE, Mate, and more with generic styles.** It's also perfect for blending into your favorite tiling window managers like **XmonadWM**, **AwesomeWM**, **BSPWM**, and more! Itâ€™s **so smooth**, your desktop might just ask you out for coffee â˜•.

For design inspiration, you can check out the **r/unixporn** subreddit â€” you'll find plenty of setups.

## Alternative Installation

The themes work on versions 4.0 to 4.4 of the GNOME D.E. just follow the steps below for installation:

- Download the [themes](https://www.pling.com/u/fkorpsvart) packs and extract them
- Move the extracted files to the following paths:
  - For GTK3: `~/.themes` In this path you must move the entire theme folder.
  - For GTK4: `~/.config/gtk-4.0` The files to move to this path can be found inside the theme directory in the `gtk-4.0` folder,
    copy only the `assets`, `gtk.css` and `gtk-dark.css` files or create a symlinks.

### Applying Themes from zip files

- For GTK3, apply themes from **Gnome Tweaks**.
- For GTK4 applications it is only necessary to have moved the `assets`, `gtk.css` and `gtk-dark.css` files to the `~/.config/gtk-4.0` path,
  and if you notice that the theme has not been applied, just close and reopen the application.
